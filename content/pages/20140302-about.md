Summary:    All about this site

I'm Dan Chudnov, a hacker/librarian currently enjoying too much free time.

I started this site over a decade ago, while I was studying data science as a
master's candidate in the [GW Business Analytics](http://gwanalytics.org/)
program.

Now that I'm using that free time to build some things, I've
re-animated this site and will be publishing here again. Don't be
surprised to see new stuff.
