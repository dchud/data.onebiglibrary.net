Title:      about
Summary:    All about this site

I'm Dan Chudnov, a hacker/librarian studying data science as a
master's candidate in the [GW Business Analytics](http://gwanalytics.org/)
program.

This site is for studies and experiments in publishing
data on the web.

If you want to know more, my stodgy older site is
[onebiglibrary.net](http://onebiglibrary.net/).  You can find a
[professional bio](http://onebiglibrary.net/bio) there as well.
