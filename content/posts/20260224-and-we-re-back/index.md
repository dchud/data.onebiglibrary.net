I've reanimated the site and updated all the bits, and will be publishing here
again. Hooray.

The short-form update: I spent 10 years as a data scientist, doing work
I enjoyed a great deal and had meaningful impact and reach, but then federal
government funding priorities shifted. Now there's Claude, so I'm working on
stuff. If you're reading this, you will see more soon!

Thanks for sticking around. Seriously. It means a lot.
